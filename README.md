# Data Controller 1.0
This program will serve as a component in an ETL pipeline , by using the kaggle API to pull datasets from the web , and directly send them into an s3 bucket.

## Version 1.0 goals
In the first release of this software , we will be sure to include 
    - Ability to write-in the name of the user and his/her dataset to use
    - ability to use s3 bucket ,
    - testing to ensure reliability and secure transfer of data 

## Future Improvements
I later plan to create a capabilities to allow users to use prefix in the cli to specify if they want a copy of said dataset in a specified golder
